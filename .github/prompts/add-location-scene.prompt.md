Implement one playable location scene.

Read first:
- docs/game_vision.md
- docs/core_loop_rules.md
- docs/content_scope_v0.md

Build:
- town locations
- walkable top-down map
- inn
- shop
- recruit point
- at least 2 NPCs with dialogue choices

Time rules:
- walking is free
- door open = 1 minute
- each dialogue option selected = 1 minute
- shopping = 5 minutes
- recruiting = 10 minutes

Also:
- add UI for current time/day/gold
- ensure entering and exiting the location returns correctly to the overworld
- keep art placeholder and readable
